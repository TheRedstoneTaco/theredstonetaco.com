Hey, I'm Dustin and I design, code, and publish stunning web pages.
For ease of coding, I have all my homepage files listed plainly in
the master directory. For organization and easy of coding, all
other webpages on this site are listed under the "sidepages" directory, each with their own directory. For expansive projects, I put
the css and js in their own directories, but most projects are
like the homepage, all mixed together in the same directory.

I'm starting up my own css and js library called Sleek, but the brand
name isn't certain. The JavaScript requires jQuery, atm.

Also, I included a directions.txt file for reference when I
need directions on things!

Have fun! :)
