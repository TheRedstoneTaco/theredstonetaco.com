You're going to design your webpage so you can easily add
and remove countries, the countries are added to the page
on document ready, instead of document load, and also you
can make a typeahead gadget that highlights matches that
match the value of the search bar.

* specifics
  - on keypress, keyup, keydown, paste of the search bar,
    there will be a function, that will grab the value of
    the search bar, find all that matches and amount of
    matches that match the search bar value, if matches >
    1, highlight all matches yellow, if matches == 1,
    highlight that match red, if matches == 0, display
    an error, also scroll to first available match no
    matter how many postive amount of matches
  - you're going to have an array of objects, where each
    object is a country, with a title and pseudonym
  - on document ready, javascript will iterate over the
    array of countries, appending each country to the
    page
  - make sure to check matches that are both exact
    matches, psuedonyms, and any case
  - it's DRYer and easier to have a highlight function
    that takes in the index of the country in the
    countries array and a color to highlight it
