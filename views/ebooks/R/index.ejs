              God, personally and actually, quickened me specifically about the word "intelligence" as I was praising
              it in my mind.

          <p>
            I used to judge everyone as either "intelligent" or not.
            <br><br>
            What if a girl wasn't "intelligent"? What if she <strong>was</strong> "intelligent"? (oh no.)
            Blunty, is a girl a subject, an equal, or a dominant if she's more or less "intelligent" than you? Neither,
            we're all humans, we're all minds, blessed and spiritually gifted in one way or another, woman are our
            helpers, partners, equals, friends, sisters, daughters, mothers, and fellow humans.
            <br><br>
            Women are biologically different than men. They think differently, they're naturally original in their
            evaluation of priority, enhanced in their ability to discern real life problems. With interview and
            observation, heavy evaluation and time, I've developed guidelines and techniques.
            <br>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Women: they know what's up. They know what's up in relationships, they know what's up in
                why you are, and they know what's up with other women.
              </li>
              <li>
                They are naturally dependent
              </li>
              <li>
                They are scientifically worse at video games
              </li>
            </ul>
            One mystery is a woman's relationship with God. I have trouble wrapping my mind around what that is
            like - I'm a son of God, I have my problems, my mindset, what is a woman + God? I want insight.

            (Look at context for "intelligence" in "Basic")
            <br><br>
            <strong>Rick and Morty</strong> with the "intelligence" game. Rick was a god (little 'g'). No limits, solve any problem,
            walking around with confidence (see invincible bubble vacation episode), loved in pop culture.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Rick.</strong> All people that are (were and are) in my path of life think about him all the time. "OH rick did
            <strong>X</strong> secretly", "Rick is actually thinking like <strong>X</strong> 24/7!", "OH
            <strong>(new idea about rick)</strong>".
            <br>
            Rick is actually thought up by <strong>humans</strong>, constructed with design decisions, and nowhere near as powerful
            as we worship him as. Rick is a human. If he solved all philosphy, he would be confronted with the truth,
            which is God. If he couldn't solve all philosophy, he would be confronted with his weakness: his human
            nature. If his thoughts are too high for me to understand, then you can't think about him either and he is
            at that instant effectively God. And he's not God!
            <br>
            If Rick has the supposeduly most powerful power, "intelligence" (remember, he's us projected onto an idol)
            and still hasn't found life, then you never will.

            <p>
              Further than "intelligence" (concept used outrightly and frequently), Doctor Who touches down
              that "intelligent" humans must be more mature. That someone with as great "intelligence" as the
              Doctor must live in a constant drunkeness of sorrow and pain.

              Outthinking villains, spreading his symbol, relating to humans, structuring with the same patterns
              as Rick and Morty, distracting with interest.
            </p>
            <p>
              <strong>Doctor Who</strong> is an idol, more commonly a peacock, less commonly a hero, less commonly a Rick,
              and even less commonly and at his core, an idol.

        <br>
        <p class="title3">Chat Interactions</p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          I detect, counter, and scramble patterns 24/7. By what people say
          and the way they say it, also because of the extreme simplicity of
          words on a screen, it's possible to chat critically.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pnormal">
          Some people are new to chat interfaces and are highly detectable,
          some people are experienced with chat interfaces and their chat
          style is detectable. In a big chatroom, the dominants, the ones
          that recieve the most attention, are quickly spotted out because
          of what the lowers say, in 1-1 interactions, a persons's chat skill
          first, then chat patterns, then attitude/attributes can be
          determined. I have seen very few people use this to their
          advantage. In my case, when I want to not be seen as a stereotype,
          I scramble my patterns and say the same things in different ways
          that have no correlation, when I want someone to feel more
          comfortable around me, I use the same common phrases they do, back
          to them, when I want to let someone know I'm open for discussion,
          I choose what I say carefully and use formal speech.
        </p>
        <p class="title3">Gaming</p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          In some games, there is a good mix/ratio of intensity, strategy,
          and skill. Within these games comes complex gameplay where
          patterns are used to effectively play. Here I have notes and
          perspectives on these patterns.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="title3">Attitude</p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          By listening to someone online, I can detect and use to my
          advantage their patterns, sometimes. I record, analyze, observe
          (mostly doing simple research about them like their username), and
          analyze attributes about them in order to come to conclusions. I
          have listed some attributes:
          <br>
          Time between clicks, directness, audio quality, intensity of
          clicks, sureness of speech, length of speech, time between speech,
          voice, dialect, quirks, most frequent speech, accent, and also
          plainly what they say.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pnormal">
          Gamer: Often the time between their clicks is short because they
          are able to surely navigate around, their audio quality gives hints
          about how good they could be at games (because it correlates to
          latency which correlates to both skill and a gaming setup quality)
          which therefore can almost eliminate some possibilities about the
          person, their time between speech and also reaction time to other
          speech can help determine how zoned they are, how quick their
          reflexes are, and how often they communicates. Their voice gives
          away age, which helps determine is-gamer probability. Their quirks,
          such as and mostly jokes can determine how involved they probably
          are in a gaming community and also which gaming community. What
          they say and how often they say it is important for the same
          reasons as their quirks.

        <p class="title3">Minecraft</p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          Minecraft is more simple and therefore easier to detect patterns in
          players. There are two ways to detect someone's skill level and
          play style: mouse movement and character movement. Mouse movement
          displays the player's level of confidence, sureness, aim skill,
          sensitivity settings, and in combination with player movement, can
          help determine play style. Character movement displays the player's
          confidence, experience, complexity, level of gameplay, and play
          style. A noob will usually move their mouse around too much, react
          slowly to juking, move straight forward the whole, and be really
          detectable. A good player can have multiple play styles but the
          most common one is the straight player that plays according to the
          rules, they move their mouse surely, their movements are complex,
          they turn away and turn toward with confidence, and is generally
          detectable. However, there are other play style in minecraft like
          being extremely cheeky, not playing in any way usual, doing random,
          but effective stuff, man those guys are fun.
        </p>

        <p class="title3">Brawlhalla</p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          Player skill level can be detected by movement patterns. Better
          players tend to be sure and simple, while worse players tend to be
          spammy and everywhere. However, detecting skill level is simpler
          by looking at the stock instead of the players. So really, this is
          where brawlhalla differs from minecraft, in minecraft, movement is
          highly detectable.
        </p>

        <p class="pnormal">
          Players will execute their favored strings or even true combos,
          it's a fact. During a match, it's possible and useful to remember
          every move an opponent makes, find the most prevelant moves,
          compare them with the character's move set, and weigh them with
          bias to determine the opponent's likely moves. For example, from
          the beginning of the match, you record mentally your opponent's
          moves, figure out they like to use dash->signature moves, their
          character has a relatively quick sig execution time, and they seem
          to be a risky player, you can determine they will use dash sigs on
          the ground and counter accordingly.

          Introduction
        </p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          Avengers Infinity War, pre-watching was supposed to be the greatest and
          latest story-based film with action to keep me zoned in. It delivered.
        </p>

        <p class="title3">
          Technology
        </p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          The movie started with Thanos's great combat and I thought of him
          studying and thinking over fights in order to gain his skills.
          It transformed with new tech, new dynamics, and Tony Stark, I thought about
          Operating Systems, does Tony have a different Operating System for every
          device? what programming language does he use? what does romantic love without
          godliness feel like, as portrayed between him and pepper?

        <p class="title3">
          Critical Thinking
        </p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          I then thought about strategies and critical thinking. How to save doctor strange
          from someone who could penetrate him with shards? The enemy probably set up
          things so if he died, doctor strange would also die, and so it's a hostage
          with a gun to his head, how do we save him? Peter Parker made a good guess
          that disctracting the enemy instead of killing him, would work. It did.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="title3">
          Nothing is defined, anything can be possible
        </p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          The movie moved on to a bigger universe. What if Tony Stark was pushing his
          mind to the max his whole life on the off chance that something like
          this would happen, working nonstop to prepare for it? I wanted to come
          home and make a critical thinking course on "humanity is spaceships and
          technology. Operating Systems, design, practical knowledge, nothing is
          preschool math class where you know you can solve the problem and everything
          is safe and your skills are within bounds. Nothing is sure, solve these problems,
          maybe, do your best." course that would get people into the real knowledge
          and awakening that nothing is pre-defined or pre-known by man so that we
          would begin to question and work harder. Such as, why should I stay web development
          when I can study, design, make programming languages and operating systems? I shouldn't
          be solving problems that I know I can solve, I should be solving problems
          that no one knows what will happen.

        <p class="title3">
          Start of the Real Story
        </p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          The movie progressed to Thanos's real intentions coming out, and also I was
          still passively studying combat and imagining what if doctor strange surrounded himself
          in a box of portals so nothing could get to him except from 6 places in existence.
          Thanos's experience and knowledge were being revealed, as well as the soul stone
          foreshadowing (I don't do foreshadowing, never able to pick it up until the
          first time I really thought critically about something, this movie) that
          he would pay everything. I was now thinking about philosophy.

        <p class="title3">
          Philosophy
        </p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          Now here is iron man, spider man, and the guardian gang (except the green one)
          fighting thanos. The true definition of Thanos's plan comes out: Kill half
          of the people in the universe at random. But here is our heroes trying
          to preserve the universe in it's current state, which is free will.
          Who is right? No one is right. They are all not God, the true God. When the
          gauntlet is almost off Thanos, it's a quiet struggle of two sides who both
          think they are doing the right thing. Impactful.

        <p class="title3">
          "End Game"
        </p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          Now the movie progresses on to the "end game" (a character, I forgot who). Thanos defeats the
          heroes, then Thor kills him, but not actually. Thanos activates the gauntlet. Cut scene to
          Thanos and Gommorah walking on water under a tagoda and Thanos has accomplished what
          he thought was right and has admitted to paying everything that mattered to him.

          Punchline
        </p>
        <p class="pnormal">
          The punchline. Half of everyone in the universe dies at random.
          The closest people to everyone dies, by withering away, in front of them.
          Peter Parker realizes he is going to die, and with seconds to live, begs Iron Man
          to save him because he has no God to trust in. No hope, no knowledge, no trust, no purpose.
          He says, "No, no, please, please save me, please" to a mere human that he realizes will
          never be able to save him and that stares him in his face unable to do anything.
          The movie ends.

          - 6/3/18, 12:56 PM
        </p>
        
        <p class="pnormal">
          I wake up and go to sleep with my same problems, unless I don't, which happens sometimes. I get up and remember my mindset,
          who I am, what I'm doing. What do I do? I have trouble every night deciding what I'm going to do when I wake up, I memorize
          the situation, my information, and potential solutions, go to sleep, wake up, take all the stored data, and work with it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pnormal">
          I've got so many problems. If I had another mindset, I'd have different problems, but there are mindsets I'd take on in a
          heartbeat, such as closeness with God. I know my problems well, the solution comes in knowing myself and guidance. Young
          love: my experiences, my research + observations, I know the patterns, the patterns are there every day, how do I solve
          them? Going over conversations, making up conversations, iterating, thinking, adding. These people I look at that do things
          I notice, I prove biblically in my mind what the better way is, but I do the same things. I was the same person, on and on,
          evidence, thinking, realizing. I know the patterns well, I remember my past actions, learn, try to do better.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p class="pnormal">
          But I don't remember everything, I realize that my mind is a constantly working, God-created gift. I realize that my
          mindset is something God gave to me because I was specifically made to bear it and enjoy it. I realize, and will probably
          edit the "Intelligence" section, that no matter how expansive or skilled or how fit your mind/set is for solving all of the
          problems you've always known and always carry, two things. You're never going to run out of problems, and it is impossible
          to move forward without changing. These hold in our current, human incompleteness as described by the Bible
          (1 Corinthians 13:8-13). Every day I think over, pick up new, and realize more about my problems. I've got so many
          questions that have real answers, I'm always me, but I want to change. I have, and it has answered many of my problems. I
          need less of Jesus and more of me before I get anywhere with these problems I've known my whole life.
